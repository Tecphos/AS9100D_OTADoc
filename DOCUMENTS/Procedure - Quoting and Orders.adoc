[arabic, start=3]
. *[.underline]#CAPTURE OF REQUIREMENTS#*
[arabic]
.. During the [name of your quoting or business development process]
    process, customer requirements are captured and recorded.

.. Details here on how such requirements are captured, typically by
    sales or other business development staff. Include a reference to
    whatever records are used to record this information.

.. [Who?] will also ensure that [Short Client Name] has suitable access
    to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements which may apply
    to the work.

.. [Who?] will also document any requirements not specified by the
    customer, but for which [Short Client Name] knows will apply to the
    work.

. *[.underline]#REVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS#*
[arabic]
.. [Who?] will oversee the review of incoming requirements, to ensure
    [Short Client Name] has the capability to meet those requirements. This
    must occur before any commitment to provide the [Products or Services
    Plur.] to the customer.

.. Details here on how the review is conducted, and what records are
    kept of the review and approval.

.. The review of requirements may require a formal risk assessment, at
    the discretion of management. If so, the risk assessment shall define
    the expected risks associated with the work, as well as a mitigation
    plan for each identified risk. If useful, risks may be ranked by
    likelihood of occurrence and severity of the impact of the risk, if it
    does occur. Management may elect to accept certain risks as a function
    of doing business, but if so, this must also be indicated. When a risk
    assessment is conducted, this will be filed with the appropriate
    requirements information where?.

.. If a formal quotation is to be prepared for the customer, this shall
    be developed by the [who?] with input from all proper departments and
    staff, and released to the customer after reviewed and approved by
    [who].

.. When a contract or purchase agreement is subsequently received, it
    shall be reviewed by [who?] to ensure there are no differences between
    it and any previously submitted quotations. If there are differences,
    the [who?] shall resolve these with the customer before the contract is
    accepted.

.. Acceptance of a contract or purchase agreement is to be done by
    [who?] and recorded [how?].

. *[.underline]#CHANGES TO REQUIREMENTS#*
[arabic]
.. Where the customer requests changes to active work, the changes must
    also be captured, reviewed and approved prior to committing to the
    change.

.. The change will consider the impact on work already delivered, work
    underway, and planned work. Problems or concerns over implementing the
    change will be communicated by [who?] with the customer. Such changes
    may require renegotiation of contracts.

.. If changes are agreed upon, the [who?] will work with the affected
    departments to implement the change. The disposition of existing work
    shall be determined by management, along with input from the customer.

.. Where changes are required by [Short Client Name], these will be
    negotiated with the customer before implementation, and a record of the
    customerâ€™s acceptance maintained.
