. *[.underline]#RESPONSIBILITY#*
[arabic]
.. The [who?] is responsible for implementation and management of this
    procedure.

.. This procedure may be subject to customer or regulatory approval; if so,
    it will be submitted for said approval and updated accordingly to comply
    with any external recommendations or requirements.

. *[.underline]#CONTROL OF COUNTERFEIT ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS#*
[arabic]
.. *PURCHASING CONTROLS*
[arabic]
... Evaluation of electronic component suppliers shall determine if the
    supplier is an OEM, Authorized Manufacturer or Franchised Distributor.
    This information must be readily verifiable.

... Purchasing preference will be given to purchasing electronic parts from
    OEMs, Authorized Manufacturers or Franchised Distributors. Purchasing
    from unverified sources or brokers is discouraged.

... In all cases, purchases of electronic components shall include
    requirements for providing documentation of traceability that satisfies
    contract requirements and provides sufficient confidence that the parts
    are not counterfeit.

... Purchasing from brokers or other non-verified sources is only allowed
    when the inspection and certification requirements controls in section 8
    below are met. All such requirements must be met before any such parts
    may be used in manufacturing.

... When purchasing aerospace electronic components from Brokers, accredited
    certification of the Broker organization to AS9120 is highly preferred,
    as this provides an additional level of confidence in the Broker’s
    quality management system.

... image:media/image1.png[image,width=325,height=550]The illustration at
    right may be used as a means of determining the level of risk when
    selecting electronic part suppliers.

... Additional contractual requirements may be added to the company purchase
    orders, in order to contractually obligate the supplier to provide
    non-counterfeit parts. Examples of such contractual requirements are
    defined in *_SAE AS5553_* Appendix D.

.. *INSPECTION & CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS*
[arabic]
... All electronic parts shall be received with a Certificate of Conformance
    certifying that the component provided is the part number procured by
    the company.

... If the parts are ordered from a Franchised Distributor, the Certificate
    of Conformance must provide traceability to the OEM. The preferable
    method is for the Franchise Distributor to provide a copy of the OEM’s
    certificate for the lot number being supplied, along with the Franchised
    Distributor’s certificate.

... For parts purchased from a broker or other non-verified source, the
    parts must have sufficient documentation to provide traceability to the
    OEM. The preferable method is for the Broker to provide a copy of the
    OEM’s certificate for the lot number being supplied, along with the
    Broker’s certificate. The Broker’s certificate must warrant the parts as
    being “original” (that is, not refurbished or reworked.) *_If the Broker
    cannot meet these conditions, the items may not be procured from the
    Broker, unless the exception conditions defined in section 9 are met._*

.. *EXCEPTION CONDITIONS*
[arabic]
... If any supplier – whether OEM, Authorized Manufacturer, Franchised
    Distributor or Broker – cannot provide the necessary certification,
    parts may be subjected to third party testing to confirm their adequacy.

... Selected third party test labs must be approved by both the company and
    the customer receiving the parts in question.

... Test lab accreditation to ISO 17025 is highly recommended.

... The company and the customer will agree on the standards to which the
    components shall be tested, and provide that to the test lab. The test
    lab must have the capability to test to the agreed upon standards.

... The test lab will provide documented test results which include evidence
    of conformity or nonconformity, uncertainty, devices used, calibration
    status of devices, and atmospheric conditions under which the testing
    was conducted.

.. *EXAMPLES*
[arabic]
... The following are examples of counterfeit parts:
[arabic]
.... Parts which do not contain the proper internal construction (die,
    manufacturer, wire bonding, etc.) consistent with the ordered part.

.... Parts which have been used, refurbished or reclaimed, but which are
    represented as new product.

.... Parts which have different package style or surface plating/finish than
    the ordered parts.

.... Parts which have not successfully completed the OEM’s full production
    and test flow, but which are represented as completed product.

.... Parts sold as upscreened parts, which have not successfully completed
    upscreening.

.... Parts sold with modified labeling or markings intended to misrepresent
    the part’s form, fit, function or grade.

. *[.underline]#CONTROL OF COUNTERFEIT MATERIAL#*
[arabic]
.. *PURCHASING CONTROLS*
[arabic]
... When purchasing raw materials, the [who?] will assess potential sources
    of supply to determine their likelihood of delivering authentic and
    conforming materiel. This is done as part of supplier evaluation defined
    in the procedure [Purchasing Proc. Title].

... Relative to counterfeit product control, assessment actions may include
    surveys, audits, review of product alerts, and review of supplier
    quality data to determine past performance.

... In assessment of suppliers relative to their ability to produce
    non-counterfeit materiel is based on their known reputation, role in the
    supply chain, past performance (if known) and whether or not the
    supplier has been involved in known counterfeit incidents. As a result,
    prioritizes purchasing raw materials from original manufacturers,
    authorized suppliers, or other legally authorized sources.

... When the procurement is not possible from the authorized chain, then
    risk a risk assessment will be conducted on potential suppliers in
    accordance with the procedure [Risk Management Proc. Title].

... Purchase orders submitted to approved suppliers shall specify flow-down
    of applicable requirements of this document to appropriate contractors,
    their sub-contractors, and distributors.

.. *VERIFICATION OF PURCHASED PRODUCT*
[arabic]
... Overall receiving inspection is defined in the procedure [Purchasing
Proc. Title].
... Receiving inspection shall aim to detect of any counterfeit materiel
    prior to acceptance. These activities are based on the risk of the
    materiel on final product, and include:
[arabic]
.... review of data deliverables (certificates, test reports, etc.)

.... validation (third party laboratory testing)

.... visual inspection (including research on marking requirements, Item
    Unique Identification (IUID) scan

.... non-destructive evaluation

.... destructive testing

... The procedure [Purchasing Proc. Title] defines the steps necessary to
    review incoming certificates of conformity to identify potentially
    counterfeit materiel, as well as certificate validation through third
    party testing.

... The procedure [Purchasing Proc. Title] also defines the steps necessary
    to visually inspect incoming product in order to identify potentially
    counterfeit materiel.

.. *MATERIAL CONTROL*
[arabic]
... During production, excess and nonconforming product is controlled to
    prevent it from entering the supply chain under fraudulent
    circumstances.

... This is accomplished by controlling or destroying any suspect or
    confirmed counterfeit materiel to preclude its use or reentry into the
    supply chain.

... Operators will also visually verify raw materials for any unusual
    circumstances or marking that may indicate counterfeit product, and
    report it to management if suspicions arise.

. *[.underline]#REPORTING#*
[arabic]
.. Any occurrences of counterfeit parts or materiel will be reported, as
    appropriate, to customers, government reporting organizations, industry
    supported reporting programs, and criminal investigative authorities.

.. The [who?] will oversee these activities.
