. *[.underline]#PROCEDURE#*
[arabic]
.. *Identification*
[arabic]
... [Short Client Name] maintains records that are needed to provide
    evidence of conformity to requirements and of the effective operation of
    the quality management system. The records are identified in the table
    below, along with the controls for each record type.

.. *Storage*
[arabic]
... Storage methods are indicated in the table below, for each record
    type.

... Softcopy records and data are stored on the company server or
    computers; in all cases, computers are subject to backup.

... Hardcopy records are stored in suitable cabinets that prevent damage
    or deterioration.

.. *Retention, Retrieval & Disposition*
[arabic]
... Records shall be maintained a minimum of XX years [ define actual
    retention time; should not be less than 3 years due to ISO audit cycle
    requirements] unless otherwise indicated below or as defined by
    customer, statutory or regulatory requirements.

... Training records and other records pertaining to employees must be
    retained at least one year beyond that employee’s end of employment.

... Records that are discarded after retention shall be permanently
    destroyed.

... When archived records are stored offsite or in another location,
    these shall be stored in a controlled environment that also protects
    them from damage or deterioration.

... As required by customer contract or regulatory requirements, quality
    records shall be made readily available for review by the requesting
    authority. Such review is limited to those records applicable to the
    customer or regulatory authority, and shall not allow for the accidental
    or intentional release of confidential information to an unauthorized
    party.

.. *Protection*
[arabic]
... The listed “controller” shown in the table below must ensure their
    assigned records remain legible, readily identifiable and retrievable.

... In order to ensure protection of records, electronic records are
    subject to periodic backups, with the backup stored on a separate
    server. [Add details of backup procedures and methods here; if complex,
    a separate procedure may be required.]

... The [who?] is responsible for backup of data.

... Quality records data stored on individuals’ computers must either be
    backed up through the server (as above), or backed up manually onto the
    server. The individual users of such data are responsible when data is
    not backed up by the server. [Delete if not applicable.]

... Entries made by hand on hardcopy forms shall be made in ink.

... White-out or correction tape is not to be used on any quality
    records. The correct procedure for making corrections is to cross the
    error out, make the correction and initial it. Optionally,
    date-sensitive corrections should be dated as well.
