. *DEFINITIONS*
[arabic]
.. “Process Output” – the result of any process; these are typically
defined in the [Process Definition Doc Title] for each top-level
process.
. *CHANGES TO PROCESSES*
[arabic]
.. Management system processes will undergo changes, typically when:
[arabic]
... Improvement opportunities have been identified, typically to improve
process effectiveness
... Nonconformities within a process are identified and require
corrective action
... Conditions in the industry or company change, requiring a process to
be updated
... New processes are added which impact on existing processes,
requiring changes
... Customer requirements result in a need to change processes
... Any other reason determined by management
.. In such cases, the process must be changed in a controlled manner to
ensure proper authorization and implementation of the changes.
.. At a minimum, process changes shall include the steps herein:
[arabic]
... The request for a process change shall be documented, typically in a
[CAR Form Name] per the procedure *_[Corrective Preventive Action Proc.
Title]._* The justification for the change shall be recorded.
... The change shall be reviewed by appropriate management, including
the senior most manager responsible for the process. Changes must be
approved prior to implementation.
... The appropriate *_[Process Definition Doc Title]_* will be updated
to reflect the change. This document will undergo review and approval
per the procedure *_[Control of Documents Proc. Title]._* The revision
indicator of the *_[Process Definition Doc Title]_* will be incremented,
and the nature of the change recorded.
... The follow-up verification step of the CAR process shall seek to
ensure the change has had the intended effect, and/or has improved the
process. If not, the change may be rolled back or a new change made to
correct any new issues that arise as a result of the change.
. *CHANGES TO PROCESS OUTPUTS*
[arabic]
.. The methods for changing process outputs are typically defined in the
*_[Process Definition Doc Title]_*. Where a process output is a
document, the rules for changing documents above shall apply.
.. Formal changes to process outputs will be used when the change is
significant. Minor changes may be made without formal control, however
the decision on what constitutes a significant vs minor change must be
agreed upon by those involved in the change. If a customer indicates a
change is significant, this will trump any internal decision.
. *CHANGES TO DOCUMENTATION*
[arabic]
.. Management system documents undergo changes when there is a need to
revise them.
.. Changes to documentation are done in accordance with the procedure
*_[Control of Documents Proc. Title]._*
. *CHANGES TO ORDERS OR CONTRACTS*
[arabic]
.. Changes to active orders or contracts may occur when the customer
changes the requirements after the work has begun, or may be initiated
by [Short Client Name] when unforeseen circumstances are encountered.
.. When changes are initiated by the customer, the new requirements will
undergo the same review and acceptance per the procedure [Quoting and
Orders Doc Title]. If the changes cannot be accepted by [Short Client
Name], a satisfactory solution will be negotiated with the customer.
.. When changes are initiated by [Short Client Name], the who? will
notify the customer and negotiate a resolution.
.. In all cases, when changes are agreed upon, they shall be initiated
as follows:
