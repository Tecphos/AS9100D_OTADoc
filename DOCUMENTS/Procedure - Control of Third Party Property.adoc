. *[.underline]#PROCEDURE#*
[arabic]
.. [Short Client Name] occasionally works with items provided by
    customers, suppliers or subcontractors. These may include:
    * List types of third party property here; typically include:
    * Products
    * Tooling
    * Measurement equipment
    * Intellectual property, such as drawings, specifications
    * More
    * More
.. For “hard” property (physical items) these are identified with the
    customer name and any applicable identifiers. Where deemed appropriate,
    such property may be physically secured in locked, limited-access areas.

.. If the property requires calibration and/or preventive maintenance,
    the responsibilities and methods for such will be negotiated with the
    customer and documented.

.. If the amount of third party property stored in-house becomes
    significant, the [who?] will develop and maintain a log of customer
    property to maintain an accurate inventory.

.. Such third party property shall be preserved as if the items were
    owned by [Short Client Name], in accordance with the procedure
    *_[Preservation Proc. Title]._*

.. For “soft” property (intellectual property, documentation, software,
    etc.) these are maintained to ensure ongoing legibility and good
    condition.

.. Such intellectual property is stored on the server and identified by
    the customer name [<- modify as necessary], and protected from
    accidental deletion or alteration, as well as protected from
    unauthorized access.

.. Electronic versions of customer-provided intellectual property are
    maintained on secure, backed-up company servers.

.. In all cases, damage or loss of customer property will be promptly
    reported to the customer for disposition or instructions.
